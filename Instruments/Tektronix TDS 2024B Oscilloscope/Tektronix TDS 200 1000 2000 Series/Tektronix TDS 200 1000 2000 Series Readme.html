<h4>2. Required Software</h4>

<para>Some software components need to be installed before using this instrument driver. Minimum versions of these components are listed below, and can be downloaded from the Download Site.
<br>

<br>

VISA 5.0 or later
<br>

<br>

For more details, refer to the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> under <i>Help &raquo; Search the LabVIEW Help</i>.</para>

<h4>3. Known Issues</h4>
<para>
-This driver does not support the Power Analysis functions for the TPS2000 models.
<br>
<br>
-The "Channel" ring controls are not consistent with regards to what integer value they pass for the corresponding text value.
     This is only an problem if you want to use the same Channel ring control to select the channel for all of the VIs that take a
     channel input.  This is not being changed in the instrument driver since existing applications are using the VIs without any problems.
<br>
<br>
-Channel values of some VIs are not unified. Channel values of two VIs named "Read Measurement.vi" and "Read Measurement (2 Channels).vi" start with 1, but that of other VIs start with 0. If we unify all channel values, there might be a possibility that users have backwards compatibility issues with their applications. To preserve the backwards compatibility, we decide to keep all channel values unchanged and don't unify them.

<h4>4. Revision History</h4>

<para>The latest version of this and other LabVIEW and LabWindows/CVI instrument drivers can be downloaded at the <a href="http://www.ni.com/idnet">Instrument Driver Network</a>.<br>

<br>

REV 2.0, 9/26/2005<br>

Modified by: Rob Hammond, Austin,TX.<br>

<para>Original release for LabVIEW 8.0. LLB-style drivers are named tktds1k2k and tktds2xx.<br>

<br>

REV 3.0,  9/6/2006  <br>

Modified by: Jaustin Ohueri, Austin, TX<br>

<para>Added support for USB B series oscilloscopes.
<para>Error query was modified, since ERRLOG command was incorrect and error codes in private Classify Error VI were updated.<br>
<br>
</para></para></para></para>
REV 3.1, 1/14/2009  <br>

Modified by: Edward Zhang<br>

Added support for TDS1001B-SC, TDS1002B-SC and TDS1012B-SC. 

<br><br>
REV 3.1.1, 1/29/2009  <br>

Modified by: Nathan T.<br>

Changed Tektronix TDS 200 1000 2000 Series Acquire Continuous Waveform.vi so that it calls an Initiate outside of the loop and a Fetch inside of the loop.<br>
This is to fix an issue that occurred when the timebase was configured to 1 second or more.

<br><br>
REV 3.1.2, 09/30/2009  <br>

Modified by: Alvin Tang, Austin, TX.<br>
Configure Channel.vi<br>
-Changed the documentation for Vertical Range Control from "Pass the value of the input range the oscilloscope uses for the channel" to "Sets the vertical gain of the specified oscilloscope channel"<br>
-Changed the units for Vertical Range control from V to V/div (volts per division)<br>

<br>
REV 3.2, 10/07/2009  <br>

Modified by: Alvin Tang, Austin, TX.<br>
- Added Wait for Triggered Acquisition.vi. This VI is added to address the problem that the instrument is not waiting for the trigger to occur before reading the waveform. <br>
- Tektronix TDS 200 1000 2000 Series Edge Triggered Acquisition<br>
Added Wait for Triggered Acquisition.vi before Read (Single Waveform).vi. The example will wait for trigger to occur before reading the waveform.<br>

<br>
REV 3.3, 10/8/2009  <br>

Modified by: Nathan T., Austin, TX.<br>
- Added Clear Errors VI to the Serial case of the Initialize VI to compensate for TPS models that do not return a "DCL" after being cleared. <br>
- Updated to LabVIEW 8.2.1<br>

<br>
REV 3.4, 10/9/2009  <br>

Modified by: Alvin Tang, Austin, TX.<br>
- Added Wait for Trigger.vi in Low Level Data Folder. This VI is added to address the problem that the instrument is not waiting for the trigger to occur before reading the waveform. <br>
Wait for Trigger.vi uses TRIG:STATE? query to correct the behavior during Triggered Acquisition in Single Mode. This VI does not wait during Continuous Acquisition. <br>
- Read(Single Waveform).vi and Read(Multiple Waveform).vi<br>
Added Wait for Trigger.vi in between Initiate.vi and Fetch Waveform.vi. The Read.vi will now wait for trigger in single acquisition mode. However, it will not affect the acquisition in Continuous mode.<br>
- Changes made in Rev. 3.2 are reverted.<br>

<br>
REV 3.4.1, 04/07/2010  <br>

Modified by: Brandon Sun<br>
- Revised the documentation of Vertical Offset control in Configure Channel to clarify it only changes the waveform position on the screen.<br>
<br>
REV 4.0.0, 10/15/2010  <br>

Modified by: Joe Ju<br>
- Support new models : TDS1001CSC, TDS1002CSC, TDS1012CSC, TDS2001C, TDS2002C, TDS2004C, TDS2012C, TDS2014C, TDS2022C, TDS2024C<br>

<br>
REV 4.1.0, 6/17/2011<br>
Modified By: Lei Liu <br>
- Update the Read Measurement.vi to replace the "Phase" to "Pulse Duty" in the control "Measurement Type". <br>
- Update the Read Measurement (2 Channels).vi. Add 2s delay to fetch the measurement result.<br>

<br>
REV 4.1.1, 9/1/2011<br>
Modified By: Lei Liu <br>

- Update the Configure Channel.vi to replace "20 MHZ" with "MAX Bandwidth" in the Ring "Bandwidth".<br>
- Update the Configure Channel.vi to fix the following Bugs:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Range Command is done before Attenuation Command. If both values are changed, the results is that the Range is changed by the Attenuation command in the scope.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Vertical Range is divided by 10. The Vertical Range is 10 times lower than expected after executing the VI.<br>
