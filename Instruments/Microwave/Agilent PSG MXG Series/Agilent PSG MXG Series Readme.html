Using the Instrument Driver</font></h4>
<para><font ,="" face="Times New Roman" size="3">LabVIEW:<br>To verify communication with your instrument and test a typical programmatic instrument operation, you should <br>first open the Getting Started or Example VIs the instrument driver. Look over each of the controls and set <br>them appropriately. Generally, with the exception of the address field, the defaults for most controls will <br>be sufficient for your first run. You will need to set the instrument resource name appropriately. After <br>running the VI, check to see that reasonable data was returned and an error was not reported in the error <br>cluster.<br><br>After you have verified basic communication with your instrument, you might want to customize instrument <br>control for your needs. If your application needs are similar to the Getting Started or Example VI, the <br>simplest means of creating a customized VI is to save a copy of the Getting Started or Example VI by <br>selecting Save As from the File menu. You can then modify this example to meet your specific needs.<br><br>For more details, reference the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> under <i>Help&raquo;VI, Function, &amp; How-To Help.</i></font></para>
