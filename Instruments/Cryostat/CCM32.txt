NAME
	CCM32 - LabView driver for the Cryocon Model 32 temperature controller
		using the RS232 and IEEE-488 interface.
		       *****LabView 6.1*****
SYNOPSIS
	VIs have a prefix 'CCM32'.

DESCRIPTION
	The Model 32 is a four-channel cryogenic temperature controller with
	serial (RS-232) and GPIB (IEEE-488.2) remote interfaces. These drivers
	support either interface using the 'Visa' connection method.

	These drivers no longer support the USB.
