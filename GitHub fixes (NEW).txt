**GitHub issues with John and Trigg, fixed

1. You'll have to sign into your GitHub account (online).

2. Click on your profile picture in the top right, then click on settings.

3. On the left (at the very bottom), click on <> Developer Settings.

4. Click on Personal Access Token

5. Click on Generate Personal Access Token (there will be two options in the drop-down box. The top option is 
repository specific, and the bottom option is for any login attempt).

6. Name the token, determine the amount of time you want it to be used for, and check all the boxes below.

7. When done, press submit at the bottom.

8. Copy the personal access token on the next page.

9. Now, go to Git Push. After pressing okay, the dialog box will open. It will request a passphrase ("physics"),
then request a username (use your GitHub username) and password (use the personal access token). Then, 
it will push correctly.
