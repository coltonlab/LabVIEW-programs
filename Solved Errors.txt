------------------ERROR "LabVIEW failed to create directory for auto recovery vis"
after clicking "run" on the main scan program

Solution: In LabVIEW, go to Tools->Options, then click Paths, select Default Data Directory from the dropdown, and put it somewhere reasonable. On my computer, it was set to "LabVIEW:\" which seems like a ridiculous path. So I made a "LabVIEW Data" folder in C:\My Documents\ and directed it there.


------------------ERROR "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\Harddisk3\DR3"
after trying to run LabVIEW at all

Solution:
Open Disk Management and look at which disk is number 3. In my case, it was the removable drive mount, so I just moved that to a different mount letter using Disk Management (e.g. from drive K to drive L) and everything worked.


------------------Error "Could not initialize port COM1"
Solution: Go to Device Manager, go to ports, then right click "Communications Port (COM1)" and select uninstall. Then restart the computer.
