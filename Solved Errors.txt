------------------ERROR "LabVIEW failed to create directory for auto recovery vis"
after clicking "run" on the main scan program

Solution: In LabVIEW, go to Tools->Options, then click Paths, select Default Data Directory from the dropdown, and put it somewhere reasonable. On my computer, it was set to "LabVIEW:\" which weems like a ridiculous path. So I made a "LabVIEW Data" folder in C:\My Documents\ and directed it there.


------------------ERROR "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\Harddisk3\DR3"
after trying to run LabVIEW at all


Solution:
Open Disk Management and look at which disk is number 3. In my case, it was the removable drive mount, so I just moved that to a different mount letter using Disk Management (e.g. from drive K to drive L) and everything worked.
